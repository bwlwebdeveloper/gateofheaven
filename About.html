<h1>ABOUT GATE OF HEAVEN MINISTRIES </h1>
<p>Rev J V Samson was born on 2nd August 1971 in Hyderabad. He was born to Mr. J. Vinod Kumar and J. Kalavathi. Samson is the eldest son. He have three younger brothers.<br>

In 1995 Samson’s life took an entirely new meaning when he surrendered his heart and life to Jesus Christ as College friends and His mother prayed with him. His Mother J. Kalavathy is a very powerful women of God she dedicated Samson to God when he was born.<br>

Samson is the proud parent of two sons.<br>

Following graduation from Badruka college of Commerce Hyderabad in 1994, Samson had completed PGDCA in computer applications. Later He had Completed Diploma in Bible Study from Hindustan Bible College, Chennai, India and later Bachelor of Divinity in Bible Theology in 2011.<br>

From May, 1999 to the April 2003, as first a borrowed elder and then, after 2003, as an Associate Pastor of Emmanuel Gospel & Healing Ministries, Hyderabad.<br>

Samson Ministry initially included:<br>

Preaching occasionally, at least monthly from 1999. Developing and teaching adult classes (Bible and topical) every year. Serving on the church session as an 'elder' and as 'organizing secretary' for many years. Contributing to summer vacation Bible school programs - Directing, assisting, storytelling, doing elaborate decoration, and creating contests and dramatic gospel presentations. Conducting Bible Quiz, Singing Competition etc. for adults, Conducting Worship Service.<br>

In 2003, Samson was given ordination as Associate Pastor and made a personal commitment to work to keep the congregation together, not suspecting it would be ten and a half years of a "tent making" interim ministry. This self-supported ministry included preparing worship services and bulletins, arranging speakers, frequent preaching and teaching, and sharing leadership and oversight of the congregation with a session of one to three elders, while coping with the demands of a grocery store work schedule that usually had me working six "days" a week, often getting off at midnight. These efforts have been much appreciated by the congregation and were fruitful despite rough times. Attended Seminaries to know the leadership qualities.<br>

Hospital Ministry - Visiting hospitals and preaching about our Lord and praying for the sick.<br>

Outreach Ministry – Visiting small villages and preaching the gospel and explaining the importance of Salvation.<br>

In the year 2011 Samson was ordained as Reverend. Since then God is using Him in a very powerful way. Rev.Ch. Emmanuel of Emmanuel and Gospel and Healing Ministries, Hyderabad and Rev. Dr. B. Isaiah of ELIM Ministries, Hyderabad was very encouraging to Samson to start-up his own Ministry.<br>

After more than 13 years in ministry as Evangelist, Elder, Pastor Samson remains committed, more than ever, to preaching the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, teaching the unchanging Word of God, and expecting the mighty and miraculous power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
